                    <p>By 1880, The Hitherto Thriving Coffee Industry In Ceylon Had Been Ravaged To Virtual
                        Non-Existence By The Blight. Nearly <br> Quarter Of Million Acres Of Coffee Plants Were Uprooted
                        And
                        The Tea (Camellia Thea) Plant Was Accorded Its Pride Of Place <br> Instead. Thus Began The Great
                        Ceylon Tea Industry.</p>

                            Named James Taylor When Coffee Industry Was Being Severely Plagued By The Blight. The First

                        Kenyan Tea Industry. They Implemented Modern Farming Methods, Improved Processing Technologies,
                        And
                        Established Large-Scale Tea Estates Across The Highlands Of Kenya.Over Time, Kenya Emerged As A
                        Significant Player In The Global Tea Market, Known Particularly For Its Robust And Brisk Teas.
                        The
                        Influx Of Skilled Labor And Investment From Ceylon Contributed Significantly To The Rapid Growth
